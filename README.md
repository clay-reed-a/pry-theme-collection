Creating a Pry Theme is a super simple task. Even your elder kitten can do that.
In the first instance, please, check out "[Creating a New Theme][new_theme]"
article.

Steps:

1. Put your theme in a separate directory (the directory should be named after
   your Pry Theme);
2. Take a screenshot of your theme and put it in the same directory. The
   screenshot must have name `screenshot.png`. 
3. Append README file. Feel free to write README contents the way you like.
   On the merits, it would be awesome, if you describe your screenshot (the
   font and its size and background color you used there).
